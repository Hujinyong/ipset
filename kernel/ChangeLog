2.4.2
  - When flushing a nethash/ipportnethash type of set, it can
    lead to a kernel crash due to a wrong type declaration,
    bug reported by Krzysztof Oledzki.
  - iptree and iptreemap types require the header file linux/timer.h,
    also reported by Krzysztof Oledzki.
  
2.4.1
  - Zero-valued element are not accepted by hash type of sets
    because we cannot make a difference between a zero-valued
    element and not-set element.
2.4
  - ipportiphash, ipportnethash and setlist types added
  - set type modules reworked to avoid code duplication
    as much as possible, code unification macros 
  - expand_macros Makefile target added to help debugging
    code unification macros
  - ip_set_addip_kernel and ip_set_delip_kernel
    changed from void to int, __ip_set_get_byname and
    __ip_set_put_byid added for the sake of setlist type
  - unnecessary includes removed
  - compatibility fix for kernels >= 2.6.27:
    semaphore.h was moved from asm/ to linux/ (James King)
