This is the ipset source tree. Follow these steps to install ipset:

0. You need the source tree of your kernel (version >= 2.6.16)
   and it have to be configured, modules compiled.

1. Initialize the environment

   % ./autogen.sh

2. Run `./configure` and then compile the ipset binary and the kernel
   modules.

   Configure parameters can be used to to override the default path
   to the kernel source tree (/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build),
   the maximum number of sets (256), the default hash sizes (1024)
   or disable the extra compiler warning flags if your compiler
   does not support all of them.

   % ./configure
   % make
   % make modules

3. Install the binary and the modules

   # make install
   # make modules_install

   After installing the modules, you can run the testsuite as well:

   # make tests

4. Cleanup the source tree

   % make clean
   % make modules_clean

That's it! 

Read the ipset(8) and iptables(8) manpages on how to use ipset 
and its match and target from iptables.
