2.1.1
 - Locking bug in ip_set_nethash.c (Clifford Wolf and Rob Carlson)
 - Makefile contained an unnecessary variable in IPSET_LIB_DIR (Clifford
   Wolf)
 - Safety checkings of restore in ipset was incomplete (Robin H. Johnson)
 - More careful resizing by avoiding locking completely
 - stdin stored internally in a temporary file, so we can feed 'ipset -R'
   from a pipe

2.1
 - Lock debugging used with debugless lock definiton (Piotr Chytla and
   others).
 - Bindings were not properly filled out at listing (kernel)
 - When listing sets from kernel, id was not added to the set structure
   (ipset)
 - nethash hash type added
 - ipset manpage corrections (macipmap)

2.0.1
 - Missing -fPIC in Makefile (Robert Iakobashvili)
 - Cut'n'paste bug at saving macipmap types (Vincent Bernat).

2.0
 - Chaining of sets are changed: child sets replaced by bindings
 - Kernel-userspace communication reorganized to minimize the number
   of syscalls
 - Save and restore functionality implemented
 - iphash type reworked: clashing resolved by double-hashing and by
   dynamically growing the set

1.0
 - Renamed to ipset
 - Rewritten to support child pools
 - portmap, iphash pool support added
 - too much other mods here and there to list...
